RSA(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem".
This repository highlights the various attacks on RSA cryptosystem, solutions to the basic challenges to start with RSA and challenges applying trivial theorems from Number Theory from CRYPTON: https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/tree/master/RSA-encryption/Intro-Challenges
